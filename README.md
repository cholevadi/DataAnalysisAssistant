<h1>LangChain Agent for PySpark Data Exploration and Analysis</h1>

**Project Overview**

This project evaluates the effectiveness of utilizing Language Models (LLMs) for data analysis tasks on large datasets.

**Key Operations:**

*Loading Music Database:*

- Imports data from CSV files into PySpark DataFrames.

*Data Transformation:*

- Joins multiple DataFrames.

- Removes null values.

- Eliminates irrelevant columns.

*LangChain Agent Integration:*

- Initiates a LangChain agent using PySpark integration.

*Conversational Data Queries:*

- Enables users to ask conversational questions about the data via the pyspark-agent.

- Example Questions:

   + "How to find all records of users who have listened to Rihanna?"

   + "What are the top 4 famous genres?"

**Project Insights**
This project demonstrates how LLMs can effectively handle complex, multi-stage commands to answer free-text queries. 
While LLMs perform well in various tasks, more intricate operations may require additional user guidance. 
The project introduces a verbose option, allowing users to observe the model's step-by-step thought process leading to its final answer.
Enabling verbose=True provides an intriguing glimpse into the model's self-improvement process until it produces the most satisfying final answer.
